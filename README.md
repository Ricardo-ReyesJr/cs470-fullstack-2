**Experience and Strength**
This course has helped me finally choose closer to a path I really like. Computer Science has so many options when it comes to job opportunities. I was very indecisive I wanted to do everything and every job option within the developer space. Although there was a lot to learn. I was somewhat nervous to learn cloud computing not knowing what to expect with infinite storage. I’ve done hosted servers before, and cloud computing is not much different from a hosted space with limited storage. There are some key differences that I feel are more secure and safe. One of the most awesome things that I can say about cloud computing, specifically having AWS is that it’s managed by AWS. As a developer, you don’t have to worry about having to be working on other changes other than what is most important. Having DynamoDB and setting it up was very easy and fun, I enjoyed setting it up. 
As for my strength, I am always craving more knowledge and want to keep learning. I know that I want to have more opportunities to work with the frameworks and tools I got to use during this course. I know I will have more opportunities to develop more using cloud computing. I am ready and excited to be a Full Stack Developer.

**Planning for Growth**
Microservices and serverless architecture can enhance efficiency and simplify the management of your application. By using serverless tools, the duty to handle the necessary infrastructure is no longer yours. This enables you to concentrate on the development code. Furthermore, this allows your application to automatically scale up or down effortlessly according to the current demand. To forecast expenses with serverless tools the most effective method is to examine past usage patterns to estimate potential future costs. On the other hand, containers offer greater cost predictability since they must remain continuously operational to handle incoming requests. That simplifies the process of forecasting.
	One advantage of serverless microservices is their effortless scalability, and you only incur costs for what you consume. A disadvantage is that for a complex application, serverless might not meet the application’s requirements effectively.
	The flexibility and pay-per-use aspect of serverless tools are two key advantages and would significantly influence any anticipated future expansion.
